# STM32F411-9DOF

#introduction

This compact STM32F411 development board can be well embedded in your project. The chip adopts STM32F411CEU6, with a 512KB ROM and 128KB SRAM, and operates at a frequency of 100MHz. This board integrates one ICM42688P, one QMC5883L, and one SPL06-001.

The board has a C-type connector and two 3.3V 100mA LDO regulators. There are both 25Mhz 9pF high-speed crystals and 32.768Khz 6pF low-speed crystals on board.

This development board is suitable for robots, drones, intelligent wearables, and more.
